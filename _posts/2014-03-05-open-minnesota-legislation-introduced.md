All communities must be better prepared for the opportunity.</span> The idea for this legislation was sparked by huge momentum and government interested in participation with [Open Twin Cities][1] and a conversation among [Rep. Steve Simon][2], Open Twin Cities Co-Founder [Bill Bushey][3], and [E-Democracy.org][4] Executive Director and [CityCampMN][5] founder [Steven Clift][6] in November 2013. Bill Bushey is also the Technology Director for E-Democracy. Steven Clift was the founding director of the state's North Star portal (now mn.gov)  in 1995. Excitement has grown with our connection to [Sen. Foung Hawj][7] (simply pronounced "her"), the Senate chief author who has a background in digital video production and public participation. With the compressed legislative schedule, a hearing for the bills will pop up with a moments notice in the next couple weeks. Sign-on as a citizen supporter at the bottom of our [home page][8].
