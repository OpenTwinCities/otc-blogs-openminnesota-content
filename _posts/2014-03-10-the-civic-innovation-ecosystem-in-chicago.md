As civic technology innovation built in part on open data and commitments to digital-age open government is taking off in forward looking cities and regions, Minnesota needs to scale up what works from there. Efforts like the [Smart Chicago Collaborative][1], [BetaNYC][2], [Code for America][3] and the [Sunlight Foundation's Labs][4] inspire us. (Read more about [what inspires us][5].) In it's first year, bootstrapping via [Open Twin Cities][6] has delivered great momentum with [E-Democracy][7] playing an incubation host role. However, this is the year, right now, where Minnesota has an opportunity to be a national, even global player in civic technology and not just a quaint little house on the prairie. <h2 dir="ltr">
  The Civic Innovation Ecosystem in Chicago
</h2>

<p dir="ltr">
  The summary of Chicago's "ecosystem" was prepared for us by by <a href="https://twitter.com/CivicWhitaker">Christopher Whitaker</a>, Code for America Brigade Captain for Chicago. Chris is also a consultant on Smart Chicago projects.
</p> The civic innovation ecosystem in Chicago is comprised of three parts: The city’s open data, the civic innovator community, and the infrastructure surrounding civic innovation efforts.  Below is a quick overview of these parts and how they spur civic innovation.   

**The City of Chicago’s Open Data Policy** The [City of Chicago’s open data policy][8] has resulted in almost a thousand data sets being published on the city’s data portal at [data.cityofchicago.org][9] with subjects ranging from crime, energy usage, service requests and financial data.  The city’s open data policy is one of the keystones to the [city’s technology plan][10]. The data provided by the city is fuel for civic innovation powering apps such as civic startup [Spot Hero][11], city service transparency websites like [Clearstreets.org][12], and [ChicagoWorksForYou.com][13]. The City of Chicago’s Department of Innovation and Technology is analyzing city data to make smarter decision about city services. As an example, the City of Chicago is [currently analyzing data to find a way to bait for rats][14] before they become a problem.  The City of Chicago recently [released a data dictionary][15] to open up the metadata behind the city’s data.   **OpenGov Hack Night** [Chicago’s OpenGov Hack Night][16] is a weekly gathering of civic-minded web developers, designers, data scientists, subject matter experts, and activists who build civic web apps that either solve problems or help educate about a civic issue.  The OpenGov Hack Night has several tracks including a weekly [Civic Hacking 101][17] sessions to help onboard new volunteers.  These nights have resulted in several civic apps including [SchoolCuts.org][18], [SecondCityZoning.org][19], and the legistlative tracking site [ChicagoCouncilmatic.org][20].   **Smart Chicago Collaborative** The [Smart Chicago Collaborative][21] is a civic organization devoted to improving lives in Chicago through technology. Smart Chicago Collaborative supports development of innovative civic applications in many ways. In some projects, such as [We Connect Chicago][22] and [Chicago Early Learning][23], Smart Chicago acts as a fiscal agent, managing development and funding sources. This arrangement allows Smart Chicago to hire top development talent, such as [DataMade][24] and [Azavea][25], to tackle challenging civic problems. In other projects, Smart Chicago supports development by donating infrastructure resources. Smart Chicago maintains [infrastructure on Amazon Web Services, Heroku, and Google Apps for Business][26]. Additionally, the Smart Chicago Collaborative conducts [user testing for civic apps][27] to aid in the development of these apps.   <p dir="ltr">
