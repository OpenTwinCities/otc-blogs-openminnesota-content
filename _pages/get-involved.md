Civic technology innovation is led by you, the public, the citizens. We bring our skills and interest and combine them with government data, nonprofit missions, and entrepreneurial spirit. We collaborate with civil servants and engage them as fellow citizens. At our meetups, code-a-thons, unconferences, and other events, volunteers bring their ideas, passion, and skills to build things that make things better for our communities. ***To get involved now, three key steps are:*** 1. Join the current [Open Twin Cities online group][1]. 2. Join the [Open Twin Cities Meetup][2] - the next gather is on Tuesday, March 25, 2014 and the Humphrey Center at the University of Minnesota. 3. Stay tuned for upcoming major "hands-on" events <a style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: normal;" href="http://www.redwingignite.org/">Red Hot Hack in Red Wing</a> in April, and <a style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: normal;" href="http://hackformn.org">Hack for Minnesota</a> in late May 2014 or propose your events in your town.
