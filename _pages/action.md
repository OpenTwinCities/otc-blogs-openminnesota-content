In the coming weeks, the legislation will likely go before legislative committees. Sign-up below for timely updates. In addition to filling out the "I Support" form below, please contact [your State House member][1] to encourage them to support "Open Minnesota HF 2611" and [your Senator][1] about "Open Minnesota SF 2238." Once you figure out who your legislators are, you can tweet [those on Twitter][2] something like "@RepXYZ Join me, your constituent in supporting HF2611 SF2238 http://openminnesota.org #OpenMN #mnleg." Or post the link on their Facebook profile or page with a personal encouragement. You can of course contact them via email. A polite telephone call is often the most effective. *Note the Capitol Code launched effort to [crowd source legislators using social media][3].* If you want to get more involved [contact us][4] or [join this online group][5] today.
